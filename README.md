#Task: Make a work-day scheduler

User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily plannerUTA-5-scheduler
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

A user clicks on slots on the color-coded calendar and edits the events.
